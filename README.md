# UVVM Utility Library
IMPORTANT MESSAGE: This repository is no longer valid. The complete Utility Library may be found in the UVVM repository (as before), but we have removed the doubling of information caused by having this "simplified" repository in addition to the full UVVM.
Please see the dedicated [info for Utility Library](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/blob/master/uvvm_util/README.md)
